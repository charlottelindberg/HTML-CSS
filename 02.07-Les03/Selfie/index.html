            <p>2. Light up your world Make sure the light hits your face from a direction that shows off your best features. You don't want aÂ photo that's too dark or too bright. These are just the basics. LET'S TRY SOMETHING MORE ADVANCED! 3. Use props
                and backgrounds. Make selfies interesting by showing your audience something. It could be the great lunch you're having or the awesome mountain you're hiking. 4. Most of all, have fun! Your selfies aren't just there to make your followers
                happy. They are, after all, yours. Capture a fun moment and make a great memory. And remember: smile! </p>
